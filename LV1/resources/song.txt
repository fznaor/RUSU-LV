I can see you're not yourself
Even when you're here with me
I know that you're somewhere else

So put another record on
Kiss and leave me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat

So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
Cause when you hold me like this you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
